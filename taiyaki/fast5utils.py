    """Return iterator yielding reads in a directory of fast5 files or a single fast5 file.

    Each read is specified by a tuple (filepath, read_id)
    Files may be single or multi-read fast5s

    You may say, "why not yield an ont_fast_api object instead of this nasty tuple?"
    I would then say. "yes, I did try that, but it led to unfathomable nastiness when
    I fed these objects in as arguments to multiple processes."

    If strand_list is given, then only return the reads spcified, according to
    the following rules:

        (A) If the strand list file has a column 'read_id' and no column 'filename' or 'filename_fast5'
                    then look through all fast5 files in the path and return all reads with read_ids
                    in that column.
        (B) If the strand list file has a column 'filename' or 'filename_fast5' and no column 'read_id'
                    then look through all filenames specified and return all reads in them.
        (C) If the strand list has a column 'filename' or 'filename_fast5' _and_ a column 'read_id'
                    then loop through the rows in the strand list, returning the appropriate tuple
                    for each row. We check that each file exists and contains the read_id.

    :param path: Directory ( or filename for a single file)
    :param strand_list: Path to file containing list of files and/or read ids to iterate over.
    :param limit: Limit number of reads to consider
    :param verbose   : an integer. verbose=0 prints no progress messages, verbose=1
                       prints a message for every file read. Verbose =2 prints the
                       list of files before starting as well.
    :param recursive: Search path recursively for fast5 files.

    Example usage:

    read_iterator = iterate_fast5_reads('directory')
    for read_tuple in read_iterator:
        fname,read_id = read_tuple
